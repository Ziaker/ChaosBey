// DRIFT — GAMEPLAY TUNING
// Kart-style hop-into-drift (GDD section 19): tap JumpDrift for a small
// hop, keep holding it while steering to slide with reduced lateral grip,
// release to gradually recover normal grip. No mini-turbo/boost — not yet
// approved (GDD section 19: "Do not automatically add Mario-Kart-style
// mini-turbo unless the user asks for/approves it").
// ============================================================

// drift-initiation hop, not the variable-height jump system (that's
// Milestone 3).

// LATERAL_GRIP_PER_S), so the Bey slides instead of carving a tight turn.

// to normal — an instant snap back would feel like the slide never
// happened.
